# feature/custom-catch-behaviour

Feature branch that implements additional catching behaviour.

Based on feature/move-improvements for improved animation code.

## Wild Mon Catches Thrown Ball

Adds new `BALL_MON_CATCH_AND_RETURN` enum.
When used, the mon will block the thrown ball and hand it back to the player.
This meant to be kind of humourous lol.
