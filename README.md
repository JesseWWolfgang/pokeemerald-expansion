# feature/shiny-wild-special-handling

Adds quality of life improvements for wild shiny Pokemon handling.

- Wild shiny Pokemon will display their name in battle in gold colour to distinguish them from regular Pokemon.
- Wild shiny Pokemon will display a special message prior to the player's Pokemon being sent out. 
    - > "Shiny Pikachu appeared!"
    - This message *requires* a B button press instead of the usual A to prevent typical grinding behaviour such as
      emulator speed-up + autofire-A from annihilating the shiny Pokemon before the player can react.
